DLNA/UPnP plugin for Grilo
==========================

This is a fork of the UPnP plugin provided in Grilo Plugins 0.2.12 and below.

This plugin, based on gupnp, was replaced in Grilo Plugins 0.2.13 by a new
plugin based on dLeyna. dLeyna offers a D-BUS based API to access DLNA/UPnP
servers.

I offer here the original plugin for historical purposes, as well as in case
someone needs an UPnP plugin but can not use dLeyna for whatever reason.

Any contribution to this version is more than welcomed. But please, try to use
the new dLeyna version, as it provides new features and bugfixes that could be
difficult to add in this plugin. In other words, you should consider this
plugin as "deprecated".
